## TUI
- Using `blessed` maybe?
	- `reblessed` looks like `blessed` but not dead! Only took an hour to find it
- Use a library for the graphics progress bars
	- Progress bar for queue processing and mass role assignment/removal
- More ways to process messages
	- Send message to message author feature
	- Inbox channel
		- How would choosing whether to process a message work with an inbox though?
- Pause queue recording
	- Partially solved by changing the hotkey to Ctrl + R instead of R
	- Functional Ctrl+C
- Quotes in CLI (will have to cook the arguments)
- Imagine like a proper shell with options
