# New Things

- Dry run of a command
- Slash commands (maybe)

## New Commands
- `respond` command (similar to `vote`)
- User-side `respond` and `vote` commands
- Make `change` usable and useful
- Command to return a value (like `change` but without changing anything)
- Argument of `log` to open it in a text viewer

## Voting
- VoteLinkâ„¢
- Automatic asking for vote justification
- Online vote checker tool

## Results
- Open results image setting
- Let people generate screens
- Don't save individual screens save for the leaderboard maybe
- Compact header (Round number on left, prompt on right) maybe

## 1b1s
- Generate input

## Statistics
- Give actual names to stat commands
- Leaderboard change over votes in a round

### Individual
- NR, SR
- Score and points earned per round
- Placements in each round

## TUI
- Using `blessed` maybe?
	- `reblessed` looks like `blessed` but not dead! Only took an hour to find it
- Use a library for the graphics progress bars
	- Progress bar for queue processing and mass role assignment/removal
- More ways to process messages
	- Send message to message author feature
	- Inbox channel
		- How would choosing whether to process a message work with an inbox though?
- Pause queue recording
	- Partially solved by changing the hotkey to Ctrl + R instead of R
	- Functional Ctrl+C
- Quotes in CLI (will have to cook the arguments)
- Imagine like a proper shell with options
