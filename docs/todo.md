- Slash commands (maybe)
- Commands with options (maybe)
	- Parameters
- Make `change` useful
- Argument of `log` to open it in a text viewer

## Voting
- VoteLinkâ„¢
	- URL is too long to fit in a button
- Automatic asking for vote justification
- Online vote checker tool

## Results
- Let people generate screens
- Compact header (Round number on left, prompt on right) maybe
- `results` command? stat?
- Generate 1b1s
- Open-ended ranges

## Statistics
- Document stats
- Custom stats
- Leaderboard change over votes in a round

## TUI
- Using `blessed` maybe?
	- `reblessed` looks like `blessed` but not dead! Only took an hour to find it
- Use a library for the graphics progress bars
	- Progress bar for queue processing and mass role assignment/removal
- More ways to process messages
	- Send message to message author feature
	- Inbox channel
		- How would choosing whether to process a message work with an inbox though?
- Pause queue recording
	- Partially solved by changing the hotkey to Ctrl + R instead of R
	- Functional Ctrl+C
- Quotes in CLI (will have to cook the arguments)
- Imagine like a proper shell with options
- Command history (up/down arrows)
- Command autocomplete maybe
